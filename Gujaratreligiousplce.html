<h2>Dwarka</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>The main draw for tourists coming to Dwarka, the Dwarkadhish Temple (Jagat Mandir), is believed to have been established more than 2500 years ago by Lord Krishna’s great grandson, Vajranabh. The ancient temple has been renovated several times, especially leaving imprints of 16th and 19th centuries. The temple stands on a small hill accessed by 50 plus steps, with heavily sculptured walls that cocoon the sanctum with the main Krishna idol. Around the complex lie other smaller shrines. The walls have intricately carved mythical characters and legends.</p>
<br>
<p>Dwarka on the western tip of the Kathiawar Peninsula is clubbed with the holiest sites in India – the Char Dhams that include Badrinath, Puri and Rameshwaram. It is believed that Lord Krishna arrived here from Braj in Uttar Pradesh to build the city. The temple was established by his grandson. It is at the cusp of the Gomti River and the Arabian Sea, providing a scenic backdrop to the spiritual site. It is said that Dwarka was submerged under the sea six times and what we see now is its seventh avatar. The temple itself has a fascinating legend. The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th-16th century. It was also feted by Adi Shankaracharya, the 8th century Hindu theologian and philosopher.</p>

<h2>Somnath</h2>
<br>
<p>Bhalka Teerth is one of the most magnificent temples of Somnath city. The temple at Bhalka Teerth is known as Mahaprabhuji's Bethak, and a tulsi tree has been planted in Lord Krishna's honour. Banyan trees dot the courtyard of the spectacular Krishna temple that is built in sandstone. Inside the shrine is an unusual idol of Shri Krishna in a semi-reclining position. The temple also contains a beautiful tribhangi idol of Lord Krishna playing his flute.

Brief History: The temple commemorates the episode when a poacher, Jara, mistakenly hit the Lord with his arrow, thinking it’s a deer. The Lord left for his heavenly abode after this episode, but not before walking 4km from here to Shri Goloknathdham Tirth. In the 9th century AD Shri Vallabhacharya gave discourses on Shrimad Bhagavat Gita here for 9 full days.</p>
